RNA seq pipelines:


(1)Raw reads (RNA) --> Genome or ---> Transcriptomes or --> no Ref, raw reads to transcriptptomes, and map raw reads to transcriptomes
and then we get .sam/.bam file

.sam file:
------------------------------------------------
 ---             ----               ----
  ----               ----      ------ 
 
 
 we want to determine differential gene expression:


conda create -n RNASeq STAR rsem
(STAR: splice-aware mapper; rsem: counting , output the number of counts)
cd scratch/in_class_assignments
mkdir RNASeq
cd RNASeq
wget https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF001RFH/@@download/ENCFF001RFH.fastq.gz -O GM12878.rep1.R1.fastq.gz
wget https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF001RFG/@@download/ENCFF001RFG.fastq.gz -O GM12878.rep1.R2.fastq.gz 
(read 1 and read 2 only for one replicate; we could use command: f loop to run multiple reads, because one replicate is not enough, we need to consider seq depth,so more replicates)
