Annotation:

Gene calling : (different from prokaryote to eukaryotes)

use BLAST to find genes. (BLASTn)


useful information to find genes

promoter region ------------------------------ (DNA)
RBS region ----------------------------------  (RNA)
start codon --------------------------------stop codon (protein)

chanllenges:
in eukarytes:
when splicing out introns, open reading fragement may shift(because introns may not be spliced 3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.)

extrinsic approach: only find genes in the database, may not find new genes (known, known)
intrinsic approach: known, unknown ; find the genes by their features/signatures


protein family: proteins that have similar/same functions  like transporters.
