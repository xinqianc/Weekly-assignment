Annotation:

Gene calling : (different from prokaryote to eukaryotes)

use BLAST to find genes. (BLASTn)


useful information to find genes

promoter region ------------------------------ (DNA)
RBS region ----------------------------------  (RNA)
start codon --------------------------------stop codon (protein)

chanllenges:
in eukarytes:
when splicing out introns, open reading fragement may shift(because introns may not be spliced 3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.)
introns problem:
(1) reference sequence like transporter 1, of its one gene has 120nt introns, but one unknown we assume has 100nt, this may be the problem, 
because we don't know how to align our introns (https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8204/detecting-introns-and-exons)
some rules for detecting introns and exons but it may be wrong.
(2)  introns can also have stop codon in it (in protein it is spliced out, but in genome it shows its stop codon which may confuse the computational 
model since they may think this is a stop codon site which actually not)

extrinsic approach: only find genes in the database, may not find new genes (known, known)
intrinsic approach: known, unknown ; find the genes by their features/signatures


protein family: proteins that have similar/same functions  like transporters.
