METAGENEMICS


shot gun: whole genome
marker gene matagenomics : 16S-rRNA: tell taxonomy




           Sample1    Sample2
-----------------------------------------------
species1(OTU
species2(OTU


identify organism: extrinsic(blast), intrinsic(look at gene patterns)

16S-rRNA: 98%,99% same with a confirmed species ?? which hard line we need to use?

raw reads --> QA/QC --> learn errors ---> correct errors -->ASVs --> bins ---> assemble --> remove chemeras --> count table
In metagenomics, binning is the process of grouping reads or contigs and assigning them to operational taxonomic units(OTU).
Binning methods can be based on either compositional features or alignment (similarity), or both.
first we use bin to group the read1 and read2 that we think is different. so we have group 1 .group2. group3/
And then we do assembly in different groups
chemeras is something we generate in the PCR error, just means mix of different DNA sequences from two sequences

           Sample1    Sample2
-----------------------------------------------
ASV1
ASV2
-----------------------------------------------


assembly way:

single molecule
read2---------------------------
           ------------------------------- read2
           only have 50bp around identity could be assembely to a single molecule
           
 
 PCR error:
from species 1---------++++++++++++++  from species 2
 (if it doesn't match the dataset, we don't know about them , we just throw them)
 
 
 out <- filterAndTrim(fnFs, filtFs, fnRs, filtRs, truncLen=c(240,160),
              maxN=0, maxEE=c(2,2), truncQ=2, rm.phix=TRUE,
              compress=TRUE) # On Windows set multithread=FALSE
              
truncLen could be replaced by slidingwindow.

OTU,98% identity
ASV:




fnfs: forward reads
fnrs :reverse reads, just names
"——“ find underline,   find the first ","  ==> ,1
we just to see several qulities to assume the whole quality of whole read 1 and read2 
C2A--> C IS CONVERTED TO A, correct the errors

R1        R2
QA/QC    QA/QC
ERROR    ERROR
ASV      ASV
==============
merge (did alignment R1 and R2)
===============
  ASV= full length
  construct sequence table
  remove chimeras
==============
 now we have bin and quality table, and then we need to put names of it , we want to add another column of sequence table to add taxonomy
===============
silva-species data provide the name  to our unknown data
==============
give taxonomy to each species.
============
count the radio of ddifferent species to find meaningful results.




PCA: the idea of pca is borrowed from ecology "study the clusters of species."
alpha diversity: richness "number of species"
beta diversity: the link of pathology and bacteria . bacteria about obesity group together, control group together
taxonomic diversity:
