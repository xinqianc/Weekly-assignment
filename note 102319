1.COG: similar functions
2.Enzyme comission Numbers: EC numbers: functions
3.GO: gene ontologies : molecular function; celllular component; biological process;
4.KEGG (which pathway; and which pathways are completed and which are lost) (consider draft genome[not finished yet, miss genes] and finished genome here)


Useful Files
T1.faa

T1.gff

Head T1.tsv
(could be open in Excel)
(contain EC number; COG)

cp de_novo_assembly/T1_spades_output/contigs.fasta prokka_annotation


 grep -c "COG" T1.tsv
use cut to leave only COG column, and use grep to count the COG

grep "COG" T1.tsv | cut -f6 | sort | uniq -c |sort -n



use transcripts to validate gene calls
use .gff file to search EC number
