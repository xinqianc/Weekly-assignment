Part 2
(1)Determine the number of protein sequences in the chloroplast
grep ">" Coffea_arabica_chloroplast.gbk.fasta | wc -l
OUTPUT:85

Annotation: use grep ">" to gather names of protein sequences together and use wc -l to count the lines of them.(Since each line is a name of a protein sequence)

(2)Create a file of all of the names of protein sequences in Coffee plant's chloroplast sequences.\
grep ">" Coffea_arabica_chloroplast.gbk.fasta > Coffea_arabica_chloroplast_name.txt

Annotation: use grep ">" to gather names of protein sequences together and use > to input the information from grep to a file named Coffea_arabica_chloroplast_name.txt

(3)How many photosystem subunits are present in the chromosome?
sort Coffea_arabica_chloroplast_name.txt | uniq | grep "photosystem" Coffea_arabica_chloroplast_name.txt | wc -l
OUTPUT:22

Annotation:use sort and uniq to put those names in order and display all but one of repeated lines, and then use grep to find lines that contain "photosystem", and finally use wc to count how many words of photosystem are repeated in lines.


(4)Make a .fasta file with the sequences for ATP synthase CF1 beta subunit protein sequence
sort Coffea_arabica_chloroplast_name.txt | uniq | grep "ATP synthase CF1 beta" Coffea_arabica_chloroplast_name.txt > CCoffea_arabica_chloroplast_ATP_synthase CF1_beta.fasta


Annotation: the usage of "sort", "uniq", "grep" and ">" are described above.

Note: 
wc -l : Prints the number of lines in a file.
wc -w : prints the number of words in a file.
wc -c : Displays the count of bytes in a file.
wc -m : prints the count of characters from a file.
wc -L : prints only the length of the longest line in a file.
