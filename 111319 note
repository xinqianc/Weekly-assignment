metagenomics:


GC content: each organism==> one peak; multiple peaks --> >2 organisms

chanllenges: assemble problem: we don't know how many contigs we are expected
spades: cut and create k-mers to do assembly

original: rRNA-->cDNA--> ligation-->..
now: cDNA--> PCR--> seq


fastq (rRNA) --> operational taxonomix unit
