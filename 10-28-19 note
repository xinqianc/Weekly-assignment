1.Genomics: Gene
- Ref: Reference-Well-characterised (fasta),Raw reads:QA/QC
- De novo: no reference; Raw reads:QA/QC-->Assembly--> Annotation: Classify, Identify--> Functional analysis


2.Transcriptomes: Gene expression level
1.relative abundance: (highly expressed or lowly expressed)
2.splice variance:same gene could code for different trancripts and do different splicing (identify transcript isoforms of the same gene)
3.different expressed under different conditions

RNAseq, qPCR,Microarray (replicates)
qPCR: can do absolute quantification
Microarray: can do absolute quantification
RNAseq: fold change: differntial abundant (statistical test: P-value); Visualization: Volcano plot, Venn Diagram

For prokaryote:
Find Oprons (different transcripts from the same transcript)


Sequence depth: how many reads you get (the more reads I have, the confident for the quality of sequence)
statistical Power:
