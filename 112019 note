Metagenomics- 
16S marker: do not have funational information
shotgun : will give us funtional information  : low abundance organisms and high abundance organisms: need to think about how to sequence low abundance one as well (may be hidden)
function: shotgun: discover the information, find how to grow them in petri dish


relative abundance:
ratio of A to B

A:counts /sample
--------------------
B:total seq of samples


  GENE1 2  3    4   5   16srna (MARKER)
---O----O-O-----O---O----O----   Organism 1
use marker gene --> find gene 1--- > function


GC content is unique to organism

physical : PCR to amplify genes that I am interested in ; single cell sequence
computational :binq sequence: 1. use marker gene 2. use similar GC content 3. tetranucleotide frequency 4.differential coverage: you should sequence the same organism equally: have same coverage
